# Bungle!

## Description
In this assignment, we provide an insecure website, and your job is to attack it by exploiting three common classes of vulnerabilities: cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and SQL injection. You are also asked to exploit these problems with various flawed defenses in place. Understanding how these attacks work will help you better defend your own web applications.
