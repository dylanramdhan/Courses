## EC 530: Software Engineering Principles

### Course Description
This class was designed to bring the basic concepts of software engineering together and practice them in real life examples. We will focus on studying different concepts that the students have taken in different classes or were not exposed to that are necessary for their careers. Examples include continuous build and integration, Modular Design, API Design, Rest APIs, Application frameworks, Containers, and Multi-Process/Multi-Threading. The class follows a flipped classroom model. Outside of the classroom, the students: study concepts, read assigned papers and tutorials; work on homeworks, which is equivalent to what other classes consider projects.
