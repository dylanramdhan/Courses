Mission of Module: If user gives two arrays of GeoLocations, match each point in the first array
                    to its closest neighbor in the second array.
                    
    Formula for distance between two GPS location:
        - Haversine formula: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula

    Compute the great-circle distance between two points on Earth using the Haversine formula.

    Parameters:
        lat1, lon1: Latitude and Longitude of the first point in decimal degrees.
        lat2, lon2: Latitude and Longitude of the second point in decimal degrees.

    Returns:
        The distance between the two points in kilometers.
