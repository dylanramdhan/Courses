### Summary
The goal of this task was to use the I2C protocol to continously fetch data from an accelerometer and give an output through monitor.


### Modules, Tools, Source Used Including Attribution
Given my inexperience with the environment the entirety of the code was generated by AI


### Supporting Artifacts
AI was used to sequentially create code snippets that would be consolidated into code that fulfilled the requirements. Code from the course's github repository was used as template for the control of the accelerometer.


### AI Use

I used {chat.openai.com GPT-4} on {9/20/2023} with the following prompt:
Next is this the starter prompt as well as a link to the conversation

****Use the information found for the ADXL343 to populate the functions and print roll and pitch in degrees, also display the acceleration sensed. When the board is stationary the only acceleration displayed should be the earth's gravity
